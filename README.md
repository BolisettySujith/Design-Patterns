# 📚 Design Patterns in Flutter & Dart

This repository is a **daily learning log** of classic **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**, adapted to **Dart** and **Flutter**.
The goal is to understand **theory + practical code examples**, with each pattern having:

* 📖 **README.md** → Concept, theory, pros/cons, use cases.
* 💻 **examples.dart** → Implementation in Dart/Flutter.

## 🔹 Why Learn Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **battle-tested solutions** to common software design problems.
They help with:

✅ Writing **scalable** and **maintainable** code.

✅ Improving **testability** and **readability**.

✅ Applying **SOLID principles** in real-world projects.

✅ Preparing for **interviews** and **system design discussions**.

## 🔹 Daily Learning Approach

📅 **1 pattern per day**:

1. Read the theory and purpose.
2. Write `README.md` with explanation (definition, components, use cases, pros/cons).
3. Implement a **Dart/Flutter example** in `example.dart`.
4. Compare with **real-world Flutter use cases** (UI kits, services, state mgmt).
5. Commit to GitHub with clear message:

```
git commit -m "Added Factory Method pattern with example"
```
